# ToDoList
My solution to one of the homeworks from CS193A Android App Development offered at Stanford. This app allows users to add new tasks to
a list. Also, it allows them to delete from the list by clicking on the item for a long period of time. When the users click shortly on 
the item, a the phone will read the task out loud for the user. In addition, I added on some features that will handle the case when the 
users leaves the app and then come back.
